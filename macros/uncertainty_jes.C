// This macro finds the uncertainty in the ratio of Z->nu nu acceptance to Z->mu mu acceptance, which is used
// directly in the data-driven estimation. It uses numbers for the uncertainty in the jet energy scale
// which are found in Summer13_V1_MC_Uncertainty_AK5PF.txt and data from my scratch area. 
//
// NOTE: To run, I've found that I need to do the following sequence of steps (maybe there's an easier way):
//
// root -l -b
// gSystem->CompileMacro("MitGPTree.h")
// .L uncertainty_jes.C
// uncertainty_jes()
//
// I tried putting the compile line in the macro itself, but this caused problems with user-defined functions
// like get_jet_uncertainty.
